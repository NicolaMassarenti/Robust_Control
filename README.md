Welcome in this repository! This repository contains the MATLAB code and the full analysis of the inverted pendolum on a cart as well as three control systems.

## What you can find here

Here a brief description of the content:

- **Robust Control of Inverted Pendulum on a cart.pdf**: full analysis of the inverted pendolum on a cart, with mechanical, transfer function and state space modelling. It is also proposed an introduction to robust control theory as well as three different controllers:
	- H2 Control with Polytopic Uncertainties
	- H2 and H\inf Norm Bounded Control
    - H2 Control with Polytopic Uncertainties via LMI
- **RC1_H2Nominale.m**: MATLAB file - H2 controller with nominal values
- **RC2_H2_NormBoundedUncertainty.m**: MATLAB file - H2 norm bounded controller with uncertainties
- **RC2_HInf_NormBoundedUncertainty.m**: MATLAB file - H\inf norm bounded controller with uncertainties
- **RC3_H2_LMI.m**: MATLAB file - H2 controller with Polytopic Uncertainties via LMI
